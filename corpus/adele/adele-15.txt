Painting pictures
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
